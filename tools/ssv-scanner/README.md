# SSV Scanner

The SSV Scanner tools enable users to retrieve events data from the SSV network [contract](https://docs.ssv.network/developers/smart-contracts).

The tool is used for retrieving **cluster snapshots** and **registration nonce** which are required as inputs for our tooling and SSV contract transactions.

### Cluster Snapshots <a href="#_ppf7v63kx7uq" id="_ppf7v63kx7uq"></a>

Cluster snapshots are objects containing data of clusters in the SSV network.

Clusters are unique to each account and are defined by the combination of the validatorâ€™s **owner address** and **operator ids** which were selected to manage it during registration.

Cluster snapshots are required for SSV contract transactions with cluster related functions which require the **cluster object** as input:

* registerValidator()
* removeValidator()
* deposit()
* withdraw()
* getBalance()
* reactive()
* isLiquidated()
* isLiquidatable()
* liquidate()

Cluster snapshots are updated after each transaction with a cluster related function, and will emit a new **cluster object** (the latest snapshot) which will be required for making the succeeding transaction.

The SSV Scanner tool returns only the **latest snapshot** for a provided cluster.

Please note that alternatively, instead of using this tool, you could just save the **cluster object** emitted in the event after each transaction, and use it as the input for the succeeding cluster related contract transaction.

### Registration Nonce <a href="#_x7nzjlwu00d0" id="_x7nzjlwu00d0"></a>

The registration nonce is a sequence number that represents the number of validators an account (**owner address)** has registered to the SSV network.

The registration nonce increments after each validator registration and does not decrease when a validator is removed.

The registration nonce is required as input for the [SSV Keys](../ssv-keys/) tool, which outputs the **sharesData** payload required for the [validator registration](https://docs.ssv.network/developers/smart-contracts/ssvnetwork#public-registervalidator-publickey-operatorids-shares-amount-cluster) transaction in the SSV contract..

{% hint style="info" %}
Please note that alternatively, instead of using this tool to retrieve the **registration nonce**, you could just keep track of the number of validator registrations you have made and use it as the input for the succeeding validator registrations..
