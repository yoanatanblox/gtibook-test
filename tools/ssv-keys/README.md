# SSV Keys

The SSV Keys tools enable users to split a validator key into a predefined threshold of shares via [Shamir-Secret-Sharing (SSS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir's\_Secret\_Sharing), and encrypts them with a set of operator keys.

In addition to the generation of shares, the tool also uses the validator key to sign the validatorâ€™s owner address and his registration nonce to ensure that only the legitimate owner of the validator can register it to the network.

The shares and the signature are constructed as **sharesData** which is used during [validator registration](https://docs.ssv.network/developers/smart-contracts/ssvnetwork#public-registervalidator-publickey-operatorids-shares-amount-cluster) through the SSV smart contract in order to facilitate their distribution from stakers to operators.
